Let's not forget that Apple Pay in 2014 required a brand new iPhone in order to use it.  A significant portion of Apple's user base wasn't able to use it even if they wanted to.  As each successive iPhone incorporated the technology and older iPhones were replaced the number of people who could use the technology increased.	1
Here in NZ 50% of retailers don’t even have contactless credit card machines like pay-wave which support Apple Pay. They don’t like the high fees that come with these.	0
I will forever acknowledge this channel with the help of your lessons and ideas explanations, Now It's quite helpful while you'll just sit at your comfort and monitor your account Growth.	2
Whenever I go to a place that doesn’t take Apple Pay (doesn’t happen too often), it’s such a drag. Between ‘contactless Covid’ habits and my getting the Apple Card, I’ve gotten so used to Apple Pay that I get seriously annoyed when a store doesn’t take it. It feels like a shock, it’s crazy how quickly it took over my shopping routine! I’ve officially been brainwashed by Apple because now it feels so inconvenient to even carry a physical card in my pocket.	0
Apple Pay is so convenient, secure, and easy to use. I used it while at the Korean and Japanese airports, no need for physical credit cards.	2
We’ve been hounding my bank to adopt Apple pay. I understand why they don’t want to do it with the extra fees, but its just so easy and quick at the checkout.	1
We only got Apple Pay in South Africa in 2020/2021 and it’s widely accepted.	2
For now, I need both Apple Pay and the physical credit card.	1
In the United States, we have an abundance of retailers that accept Apple Pay, but it's still good to carry the physical card with you, being there are still a large quantity of places that do NOT accept Apple Pay.	2
In Cambodia, we have a universal QR code system, we scan and send money back and forth, all banks take no profit from merchant, they receive 100% of the payment. A lot of stores and supermarkets start abandon POS machine all together.	1
Wow, you really went to town on the PSU test rack. That's a serious bit of kit. Very flexible, good choices. Wouldn't surprise me if Choma start offering this bespoke rack to the PSU makers. They all watch your videos, so they'll want to make sure it passes on this exact same rack. You can really push the industry here. Well done. Open source the test interface hardware and software.	2
The lab is the most exciting thing in IT I've seen for a while. This is reallly going to shake up how the qualiity of even basic components are manufactured.	2
Linus, I'm an engineer and love the LMG content across all the channels.  Very much looking forward to more lab content and hope your engineering team will get more on camera time and hosting roles.	2
There used to be a time where Linus was the smartest guy in the room, this video clearly shows that the team he has built are experts in their respective fields and make Linus look like a child. Kudos to Linus and LMG, you've grown beyond what I imagined. All the best!	2
Holy crap. I was looking at Chroma systems back when I was designing power supplies. Looks like you guys went all out! Re the multimeter: Most oscilloscopes are terrible for making accurate voltage measurements (8-10 bit ADCs). They are just for looking at the waveforms.	0
I love the direction this channel is going. Most tech channels, even the best trusted ones are going to review products based on their own experience or at most some things they can measure with their pc, but you're really going to mathematically demonstrate if a product is a quality one and why it is, love it	2
I am more excited for the LTT Lab than I have been for a lot of content for a while now. As everyone seems to be saying, it's exciting to see how enthusiastic this new crew is to get things running.	2
I adore the working relationship Linus has with his team. 99% of employees walk on eggshells around their boss and I wish it could be more like this.	2
"LMGs growth is honestly something to truly aspire for, this IS the content we want to watch. 

More technical, in depth, engineering oriented and science-based content will make us consumers much much more educated on these topics thus when picking a product not only will we pick the best choice but we'll know exactly why we picked it (which helps greatly with buyers remorse)."	2
I love all the people LTT has added for labs. Clearly they're knowledgeable and passionate about tech! Labs is gonna be killer. Love it!	2
Linus!!! Just turn the key lights  180 and bounce them off the walls. You’ll get a much softer glow and shadow and way more even lighting. It’s such a simple fix. I’m not sure where along the lines people got the idea to beam the lights directly at your face 😅	2
Dan continues to be my new favorite, he has such an air of confidence about him and a comforting presence. Like Dan shows up and you just know things are going to be fine.	2
Dan managing to set up his soldering station on the one box they needed was incredibly amusing to me	2
"Linus: *Gets on his employee's cases for all the stuff stolen from the office*
Also Linus: *Proudly talks about all the stuff stolen from work he's using in his upgraded setup*

Linus: ""Why are you using this monitor as a table?""
Also Linus: *Uses the monitor as a chair* 

This video was hilarious"	2
"Linus: ""This is not a table.""
Also Linus: Let's use this as a chair!"	1
Dan the man. Saving the day. Riley needs to give him his own theme like Brian the Electrician.	2
Dan continues to be a favourite for me. He's like the incredibly patient, but long-suffering Dad, who just gets on with things	2
Dan is a treasure. Your channel has long lacked a Mr. fixit type and while I am sad it's not me, Dan appears quite capable and funny.	2
Blows my mind how quickly Dan became the "rock" upon which all things Linus stands...Love it	2
"Hey Linus, a good trick for streaming lights: bounce them off the wall.  Much easier on the eyes, and a nice softer look.
Also, for indoors, I'd recommend a hyper-cardioid mic (looks like a short shotgun) like the Audio-Technica AT4053B."	2

Guys, a quick note that you do NOT need all the high-end tech in order to do well at college. If you can (and you should), save as much money as you can while at college, pay your tuition in full and student loans as soon as possible instead of spending on liabilities like gadgets. Get the bare minimum you need and only spend money on products you know you are going to be using for 4-6 years (such as laptop). Don't overspend on phone, headphones, lamps, tablets, etc.	1
this is hilarious. i was in a focus group over 4 years ago for Best Buy where they were asking college students how to advertise for Back to School. One of the kids next to me said "Maybe you should have someone like MKBHD talk about your products". Well... here we are	1
Everyone has been saying it but I’ll throw my hat in as well. To any prospective college students, you DO NOT need to spend money on flagship products. I am about to graduate with a business degree and have been using a 7 year old laptop and the base iPad from late 2020. Both products have worked flawlessly and I have no intention of replacing them. The recommendations listed are ones I would never be able to afford even with my job I’m working as well. Do your own research on forums to see what your peers say the best value product is. I promise that if you buy a flagship product you will quickly see that you did not need it.	2
Shoutout to my OnePlus phone and Huawei laptop for getting me through university feeling premium for MUCH less. Bonus ups for Ikea's articulating lamps ($20 and I can see all my homework incredibly well without eye strain), the old door I refinished to use as a desktop, and wired earbuds under hardware store earmuffs as my "noise-cancelling headphones." And the same 2 sets of Hanes underwear from target for also lasting the whole ride.	2
"BEST BUY: We want to sponsor a back to school type video. But you can only push the high end stuff.
Marques: say less"	1
Most of the items you recommend are pretty pricey for a student. I'm not a student myself anymore but if I were one, more budget alternatives would make this video a lot better!	1
You don't necessarily need the high-end and latest tech for University.  I used a 2009 macbook pro throughout my years at uni , had an iphone 6 and it worked out just fine. What's important is to remain focused on getting that degree and graduating.	2
Personally I feel like this is really out of touch. Most students won't be able to afford these. In case anyone needs it: I believe Dave2D's back to school video are honestly the best ones I've seen on the topic. Consider checking them out too before making a purchase decision.	2
"Hey everyone. Good take on the video and love the recommendations. If you plan on making another video such as this, maybe you can also include some more budget options and best value options. 

What I can tell from my years of studying in college and university is that your tech and needs will be based on what courses/programme you took for your education.
Engineering students require computer specs that can run BIM software. I'm not sure about the other programmes but from what I can see that most students at my place has 8GB of RAM for their laptops.

Also, here is my setup during my university years. Hope it can help anyone who are looking to buy something for their college/university years. All the best.

Laptop - ASUS X455L (Upgraded to SSD with additional RAM)
Phone - Vivo Y69/Redmi 10/Samsung A22 4G
Mouse - Logitech G102
Keyboard - Tecware TKL ver"	2
I have used Galaxy Tab S7 during my Ph.D. It's been a lifesaver for me. First of all, it is really good for reading journals, note taking and scribbling on the pdf's, secondly, it doesn't strain your eye that much when you use a computer or a laptop always at a fixed distance, thirdly you get the premium version of noteshelf free with Tab s7 and lastly if you are from a STEM background and use a lot of illustrations or flow process diagrams, you can draw those easily with the stylus on Tab s7. I choose tab s7 over Apple Ipad Air for its ease of use, user interface, and cost (you get stylus for free with Tab S7 and in most cases keyboard too with a huge student discount).	2
When he says he's a 400 year old beer wizard, I believe him.	1
This series is exactly what career day should've been, such interesting and knowledgeable people!	2
"Regarding Cans vs. Bottles: At least in Germany the bottle is more environmentally friendly, since they get used again and again. You bring the empty bottles to the local grocery shop, they then get sent to a cleaning plant, where they pressurewash the bottles inside and out with steaming hot water. Afterwards they get reused for beer. The size and shape of most bottles is according to a standard, so different brewers use the same bottles.

It's far less energy intense than smelting and remanufacturing cans."	1

Seasoned craft brewery tour guide here, and I’m so glad he ended on “Drink what you like.” Sometimes people get weirdly judgmental about the beer preferences of others. At the end of the day, there are hundreds of beer styles for a reason, so everyone can find at least one style they actually like.	2
This guy is a total bro. Not snobby at all and just wants people to enjoy beer in whatever way they want. Such a contrast with your stereotypical beverage elitists.	2
Y’all be picking the literal best professionals for these videos. Not only is everyone knowledgeable but they all seem passionate and eager to teach us.	2

Whenever we get people young enough to actually understand the internet, these giant tech companies might be broken up but as long as we have 90 year old senators asking tech CEOs how the internet works nothing will get done.	0
I live for John's roasts of AT&T.	2
Mad respect to John Oliver and his team for not making us watch ads during the show. Major props.	2
One important aspect I'm surprised was left out is that many of these companies (like Amazon) literally power the internet. Almost 30% of the websites on the internet are stored on Amazon servers, giving them even more access to data trends and physical control over the internet.	2
Shout to you John Oliver for giving me a brief trip down memory lane.  I've been in the telecommunications industry for almost 25 years - and my first job was at....MCI.  Great company that got swallowed up in a horrible merger with WorldCom.  Bing it and see how that disaster played out.	1
"Back in 2018 when John Oliver did the episode on Corporate Consolidation it inspired me so much that I applied for a Masters of Research program, got into a program, and did my entire research thesis on tech oligopolies. It was shocking to see how bad it really is; oligopolies that bordered in monopolies are rampant. My research essentially focused on the question of whether lack of enforcement of our antitrust laws caused this whole problem or whether lack of adequate laws were the core of the issue. The answer was that it was truly both. I thoroughly enjoyed my pre-doctoral masters thesis and am considering a PhD in the future. It's so lovely to see John talk about this, specifically on the tech sector!

Edit: Wow! Thanks everyone for the great comments! I haven't published it yet, otherwise I would share it with all you lovely people ❤ I am now looking for a policy or qualitative research/analyst job so if anyone is hiring, let me know 😅"	0
John Oliver deserves an Oscar for his 'Can Dolphins love you?" monologue	2
I would love to see these bills live. I live in a country where we had one company try and rule the internet, charging outrageous prices for it. They had specifically bought the copper network to do it. The government of NZ denied that as a defense as they were monopolising it, and forced them to open up. Suddenly it turned out it DIDN'T cost $300 to connect to unlimited internet, you could get that for $80!	1
Hey, something that might interest you. A couple of days ago my Amazon account was closed with no warning for after hours of wasted time they're telling me it's for excessive returns which I think is an error but that's beside the point. When they closed my Amazon account all my Amazon devices that I own for years primarily all my Echo devices stopped working. I lost access to the Amazon Photos and Prime Video which I pay for. So apparently the devices you already own are subject to be disabled by Amazon on your perceived shopping habits! I assume the same applies to all other Amazon devices and services like fire OS tablets, Ring cameras, and probably AWS as well. Just wanted to make other people aware of this because they definitely don't tell you this when you buy your hardware and services.	0
"Points that were missed: 

- Apple arguably has a specific Monopoly in the US with smartphones because of iMessage not being open with other multi-platform messaging apps. This weirdly only applies in the States. The rest of the world favours things like WhatsApp and Facebook messenger ( both owned by meta, Which is its own issue). That's probably the main defence Apple will bring up. 

- they've been in trouble before but don't forget about Microsoft, Windows 11 has seen them go back to some of their old tricks like a favouring their own software and making it difficult to remove. 

- this kind of got glossed over but although Google play takes the same cut for purchases as Apple, you are free to install other app stores and install apps from wherever you like, so they avoid the heat there. Google play is still the most preferred store on Android phones, so Google likely takes advantage of that fact in promoting its own software."	1
"Hey hey, just a heads up, I DID turn the LED Hoodie on, it's just not very bright hen you're looking face-on at it! (you can still sort of see it on around the hood area though)! 🙌

That was seriously the most enjoyable thing I've seen in awhile. I forgot how rad this channel is. Well done sir.	2
Dude, I love how genuine your reactions were! I've had fun watching this, and not only: I was really interested to see what each one of those gadgets did.	2
Infinity Dodecahedrons are seriously cool. I bought another (smaller) one, and I really enjoy it. It's definitely an eye catcher and a conversation starter!	2
I personally enjoy the old school phones.  I have such a hard time hearing my iPhone at max volume without the speaker on.  If I worked in an office I would definitely buy one.  People forget how ergonomic those old phones are.  It's not particularly comfortable holding a rectangle to your head.  I also have physically sensitive ears so any type of headphones, ear phones, whatever... cause me a bunch of pain.  Looks like a good product that can both be a gag and something for people out there like me who have a tough time using a regular mobile phone.	2
The fact he didn't buy the Nicholas Cage spoon is outrageous.	0
I have to say it after watching this video it feels like the journey you're on this year has been effective. It simply feels like you're enjoying life and its what I enjoy most about watching your videos. You manage to pass that joy on. Just the musings of a random stranger. 😀	2
I haven't laughed like this for years! Oh my gosh Arun, you've nailed this one! - Wendi 🤣	2

"If machines produce everything we need, the outcome will depend on how things are distributed. Everyone can enjoy a life of luxurious leisure if the machine-produced wealth is shared, or most people can end up miserably poor if the machine-owners successfully lobby against wealth redistribution. So far, the trend seems to be toward the second option, with technology driving ever-increasing inequality." -- Stephen Hawking	1
as somebody with a comp sci degree and a decent amount of irl experience i will say edge computing is problematic at its core because client side workload like this is a huge security breach.  this is why even online video games avoid client side scripting.  it is a huge vector for exploit.  it is always interesting to watch a video like this because you are blown away when you listen regarding these other technologies you may not know allot about but when they cover a technology you know about you realize you must question the quality of the info in the other cases where you cannot determine the quality yourself	0

Self-Healing Concrete is on paper a really good idea. There is just one small problem with it and comes from the fact that we are not using limestone for buildings as limestone has this one tiny problem with being rather frail. Yes it will make the concrete last a big longer, but it will also make it harder to see where the weaknesses of the structure is and only really postpone the disaster, if at all.	1
I've read that hydrogen can work it's way through any container material. In your piece about graphen it was  stated that it is impermiable to gases -- even the lightest one. Assuming the narrator meant hydrogen, it might be a solution to the long term storage of hydrogen, perhaps.	1
The fire suppression without water was incredible. It could save many lives and property especially if it could be auto activated like a heat detector. Imagine how much property and how many sleeping people could be saved, especially if this had a built in alarm and was rigged to keep hallways clear of fire. What an invention....WOW.	2

I like the meme that says, ‘if it bites you and you die, it’s venomous; if you bite it and you die, it’s poisonous.’ I actually think it sums it up pretty clearly.	1
I wish that when people talked about types of skin damage, they'd acknowledge what that looks like for people with darker skin. we don't get red rashes after sunburn. even my darkest bruises are often difficult to spot because of hyper-pigmentation. the stages of healing for cuts looks vastly different because we don't see the same change in colors around the wound sight. not to mention when you look for images to identify clinical signs, 99% of those images are of lighter skin and only marginally helpful to us looking to identify potentially serious medical issues.	0

My mom would've gone nuts for you while I was growing up lol. Her big "parent fear" was toxic chemicals and me getting poisoned so she was always lecturing me about stuff under the sink and making sure I didn't touch the pesticides for the farm.

The camera is amazing! And there are so many people who could benefit from it A LOT	2
I’ve been playing with the Insta360 Link for about a week now. As a college professor and edtech trainer, I can tell you that this is a complete game changer for online and hybrid teaching.  Switching from follow mode to whiteboard mode to top-down mode for demos etc. is a purely magical experience.	2
I honestly have to say, while its still insanely expensive, 3500 for that monitor isn't as bad as I was expecting. And its almost 'reasonable'. Like, its still more than I would ever spend on a single display, and I'm far more into having separate displays but, given what its capable of, the specs, the tech behind it etc. its not that bad. I can see a few people getting real use out of something like that,.	2
Imagine losing the cursor on that screen and trying to find it 💀	0

I’m always looking forward to these every month so thank you for making them. Honestly that little lamp and speaker caught my eye. The flickering is really cool to me and the speaker is a nice extra.	2
The sound test killed me, that was hilarious. And the wrist rest is brilliant, I often get marks on my wrist from my mousepad.	2
What a tough selection this month! Whether it be the soundbar, the lamp speaker or even the pc panel display they all seem something that would really improve my set up, but for me it may have to be the soundbar one,  looks smart, has nice RGB and a decent size and price. Very good month of tech this month!	2
I absolutely love this series!  All of the items were neat but the only one I would actually benefit from would be the chair wheels.  I have a regular office chair that has to roll on carpet and it is kind of a pain.	2
That sensor panel is definitely convenient. Been wanting to make my own with a raspberry pi but just find myself getting off track. Super cool to just be able to purchase and go!	2
The RGB sound bar would be perfect for my setup! I’ve been using the speakers in my monitor as my main sound system, so it would be a nice upgrade for me.	2
I always love franks energy i also look forward to the end of every month thinking about this series i love the tiltednation sound-bar and i need that for my set up😀😀.	2
always great to see this series, so many cool things this month, my office setup could use those chair wheels.	2
This series has helped me and my friends find some helpful tech that has helped our setups! The pc panel is gonna be a huge upgrade	2
We need the under $100 for August as well!! This is the best series out there✌️🔥	2
One really important point: those ionizers can produce potentially dangerous levels of ozone due to the negative ions they create in the air. I'd be cautious of all air ionizers, unless they are advertised specifically as bipolar ionizers. The one that you recommended DOES produce ozone, which can be very harmful	0
Been a good while since I've been a student but I still watched the vid to find out what cool gadgets are out there. Didn't think I'd be walking away from it with a productivity tip, that idea of the simple timer is so good, instead of devices that can also do time. Great vid ,Frank.	2
The desktop lamp is definitely my favorite. It’s also something I’ve been looking for because I updated to a keyboard that doesn’t have shine through keycaps so it’s definitely a need too.	2
I’m not a student, however I always love seeing the tech. Always looking to change and upgrade my desk setup for work!	2
"Fantastic video Frank. You always bring really cool stuff to the front that most of us haven't seen/heard anything about. Hope you and the fam are doing well XD
Btw, that kb for only $100? I know they've gotten a lot cheaper but hot damn. I don't NEED it but I want it lol. My biggest complaint with 60% kb's is the lack of arrow keys and this has those and looks super sleek with those colors. Love it. Take care man!"	2
Ugh, hate when my summer holidays end. At least you brighten my mood with this "top tech" series. Thanks!	2
the Forest app is a phone based timer app. Basically, you set a timer for however long you want to be focused for. At the beginning, it will plant a virtual tree in the app. If you leave the Forest app at all it will kill your tree	1

I love you guys. I hope you know that. 😂 You guys brighten my day with these massive tech unboxing videos.	2
The whole idea of the "Interchangeable battery to keep going" of the Steel Series is exactly the reason why Xbox still uses AA batteries for their controllers :), I think is in an undervalued decision from Xbox :(,	0
In my experience, burnout comes from realizing that improved performance doesn't produce improved rewards, it produces more work. The response to a job well done is never a couple days off or a timely bonus, instead good work is "rewarded" with the demand for twice as much work in the same amount of time. Firms see young workers as a productivity sponge to be squeezed for all it's worth, young people are almost never treated as the company's future.	0
I am 50 years old working in the high tech industry, mentally tired and sick of the weekly 8 to 5 routine. Never got a proper day off even through the pandemic.  Hats off to the millenials and GenZ that think differently and put more weight on LIVING rather than just WORKING.	0
I think the pandemic has taught people the importance of multiple streams of income unfortunately having a job doesn’t mean security	0
Successful people don't become that way overnight. What most people see at a glance wealth, a great career, purpose-is the result of hard work and hustle over time. I pray that anyone who reads this will be successful in life..	2
As someone who used to work 80 hours a week, quitting my job to become a freelancer was the best thing I have ever done. Sure I still work a lot of hours and often close to 70-80 hrs a week, I feel like I am doing this for myself and not some corporation.	2
"I have a high paying tech job that I’m about to leave. I feel incredibly blessed and privileged to have had it, even though I worked hard to get to where I am. I was promoted very fast after 5 years. I know it’s something many people would love to have and honestly I’m happy that someone else who has worked hard will get my spot. Ultimately I became burnt out and just need some time to reset my life. I have lived humbly, saved every thing I could, paid off debts as quickly as possible, and have enough to live for 8 months to a year. I’m hoping to come back into the industry as a healthier employee or have found something else fulfilling.

For anyone wishing they had one of these jobs or feel frustrated by people that appear to be complaining, I hope you achieve your dream and get one. You can do it, keep at it! Taking one of these jobs to be financially secure is a blessing. I am taking a break because my mental health and stress hospitalized me (don’t let that scare you, I just have my own personal stuff too 😄)."	2
I’m a Software developer. I understand the struggle but us tech workers should count our lucky stars. We are very privileged to be where we are. Most jobs outside of tech have less perks, much lower pay, and more stress. I am grateful everyday to be in this field. Once I accumulate enough wealth to purchase my freedom, I’ll see myself out.. maybe. In the meantime, I will run the race as long as I have to.	2
The thing is, if you give someone all of these perks and a flexible schedule, you need to also give them the freedom to use that flexibility. You must make it clear that the company expects you to take down time, and you will not be frowned upon either officially or unofficially. Leadership needs to model that behavior by taking time off and making sure everyone knows they're taking time off. This also empowers your teams, letting them know that you trust them to work without constantly staring over their shoulders.	2
"Compare that to ... physicians, only 42% said they were burned out" - Yes, indeed, a perfectly acceptable percentage.	2
I worked a low paying tech job for six years and still felt the burn out. The problem is that tech is very fast paced and competition focused. You can barely keep up. Though I got promoted regularly, my higher ups told me the truth before they left, they said that I was severely underpaid based on my skills (essentially I branded myself a one stop shop for the marketing department as I am both technically knowledgeable, people oriented and strategic). I maxed out at $50K. So I decided to jump ship with little planned. Now I run a financial agency with my husband and we make $250K a year as entrepreneurs and we have the freedom to set our own lifestyle.	0

That motion alarm for protecting your laptop makes me laugh.  If you are taking a break away from your workplace do you really think that the alarm feature would deter a thief from simply knocking the device to the floor, pick up the laptop and (perhaps) step on the alarm and crush it in a moment of disdain.  By the time you get back with your latte after your phone notifies you of your impending bad luck your laptop will be off on an extended trip.	0

The Trene Control Alarm will not deter someone who really wants it.  They will just knock that gadget off and run with your property.	0

I spent hours researching dash cams a  year or so ago and it’s almost maddening how awful, sparse and misrepresented information on dash cams is. I was totally surprised how under developed they are. This is a video that is really necessary.	0
Vids like these are definitely a service for looking out for everyone to avoid buying crap and hype in dashcams. Well done in the research! Thanks LTT!	2
A favourite trick is to upscale a low resolution image before applying the compression - that way they get to claim a higher resolution on the box.  I've analysed a few of these now.	1
I did not expect to love this video as much as I did... it epitomizes the very best of YouTube in my opinion - a well-made video with a well-constructed narrative, hosted flawlessly and provides a genuinely good service to everyone, even if they are not in the market for these products. Love your work LTT Team!	2
Thank you Linus for spending the big bucks and testing all these cameras for our benefit. I will be keeping your recommendations in mind when I purchase my camera.	2
THIS is the kind of content that we need. Calling out trash markets and helping people find honest answers, doing the side-by-side comparisons they can't do. Thanks for this! Glad to know the Rove R2-4K I got as a gift is not far from really the peak in the market and is "good enough" if not overpriced a bit.	2
"Yup, it's amazing though how the market then changes brands for each country. In germany we have an entirely different line of knock-off chinese brands. Which ultimately look alike same goes for the Australian / american market. I am kinda stoked to see though what sort of dashcams are actually used within South Korea, Japan if anybody could give a hint to that! I mean surely they must have great dashcams right? Japan being the leading technology country in the 80s and having a severe amount of car enthusiasts, and well South Korea being well the main birth place of any technology centre and fab well at least a good portion in my mind.

I bought this one due to a recommendation from a friend of mine. Problem I have with it is quality related the G-Sensor broke not long after I bought the thing and started using it kinda unfortunate. This creates an issue of the thing constantly making emergency recordings. And in that mode you can't disable the screen from flashing so at night drives you'll really get beamed in your faze and think someone put a flashlight up to your head nope. It's your f#+*^# dashcam You can improve further the video quality for e.g. when experincing intense sun glare which is usually caused on these by using a ND-Filter you just have to find your own way to mount them. Usually there is full filter clamping solutions. Because you'll have to overshoot with the filter anyhow.

I didn't do this yet as I did not find it nessecary to do so but a big german dashcam clip compilation maker did recommend this in one of his dashcam review videos half a year ago or so 
name of the channel is ""Eure Videos Fahrnünftig""

In all fairness, the VIOFO actually looks pretty great. Actually worth considering over the Thinkware F70 if the budget isn't too tight.	2
"When I went looking for a dashcam my main criteria was that it has a super cap instead of a battery, cause I really don't think the batteries would handle the -20 to -30c temps in winter and the exact opposite in the summer along with however much the sun heats up the interior. (I know you can take them off but I kinda wanted an install and forget about it kind of system)

For actual performance it's much better to just find someone elses footage cause the resolution and other specs are very misleading, unless you really know your camera sensor specs."	0
I had my suspicions about this for a long time, thank you for finally calling this issue out.  It sounds like there's a hole in the market for a truly high quality dashcam that's not Chinese crap.  Hopefully some tech company sees this and swoops in.  I'm tired of all these countless trash brands on Amazon with unpronounceable names.	0

I’d say the coolest thing in this video is the desk pc. Saves room and it’s cool to see the desk, but I wonder how much it cost and if it’s worth buying?	2
I'm just here to say thank you to him, the generosity he has shown will forever be in my heart. Thanks for the perfect job	2
i own a remarkable 2 and that feeling surreal to hold was the same thing i felt when i got it, its great for anyone wanting a device to write with for school and so much thinner and easier to carry around than a notebook or binder, especially since you can import and export pdfs for downloading and submitting assignments online	2
Man, I love how he went from a smartphone focused creator to just all inventions overall. This is incredible keep it up Arun 😃	2

In spite of the huge upgrades, especially for the Pro models, it would be interesting to see how many will upgrade to the iPhone 14 lineup, given that the iPhone 13 lineup is as popular as ever	2
Honestly can’t wait for the camera testing you do on the pros. As a iPhone 8 user anything will be an improvement though lol.	2
I’ve been holding out cause i just felt it wasn’t worth upgrading but with everything coming to the 14 pro and the diminishing battery on my current iPhone X, it might be time to retire my phone after 5 years.	1
Definitely upgrading from my 12 Pro Max to the 14 Pro Max, I'll get at least half the cost of the new phone back with trade in. Major upgrade in battery, camera, and the screen.	2
In my opinion the 13 mini is the best phone ever made. Seems I’m in a minority but it’s brilliant.	2
Eh, I’m sticking with my 13 Pro Max until probably the 15 or 16. The cameras on the 14 Pros are literally the biggest worthwhile change this year imo.	2
I'm going to wait for the scheduled iPhone 15 Pro which will be scheduled to release in October 2023 if everything goes to plan. It is expected to have a USB C port and faster charging like the iPhone 14 series. This is what really matters for me.	2
I'm getting the Pro. Been using the 12 Pro Max since it came out and I think it's too big for one hand use.	1
I might upgrade from my 11 Pro to the 14 Max. I guess I don’t care enough to spend the money on the pro Max, but I want the bigger display and better battery life	2
The information is easily digestible, thanks!	2

Love those pocket operators. Never heard of them until this video and now I've done a ton of research on em lol. Would like to pick one up someday. Thanks for bringing this dope tech to our attention good sir!	2
That LED Message Board is super cool! So many options for use. Love watching your videos and seeing all of the cool affordable tech!	2
Love the Wormier keyboard! I have a full size keyboard and the compact option looks amazing and will be a better fit for my small desk.	2
I love how there's infinite possibilities that you can do with the pocket operator. Would love to pick up one of those for exploring it!	2
My favorite cool tech gadget in this episode was definitely the audio interface as I am starting to get into the streaming world. Great episode and for the amazing content.	2
Gotta say this is one of the best episodes of the series in a while! I actually think every single one of these things would be something I'd go out to buy, especially the LED sign. I finally am picking back up my plan to build my own PC and the flexibility of the sign adds a lot of, well, flexibility on how I want my endgame to turn out.	2
"Teachers: There are no stupid questions

Wolfgang Puck: ""Well, Tracey, that's a stupid question"""	0
he's a nice fun guy, he told my dad  ( at an event my dad was cooking at ) that " he had never seen so many steaks cooked so perfectly so quickly"  and it's one of his favorite memories. we have a signed picture with him and my parents in it   : D	2

“Keep calm and smoke a joint”
“Let me teach you English”
“Tracy that’s a stupid question”
“Idk what school you’re going to but maybe you should change schools”

Idk if this was intentional but I really like how he said “practice makes better” rather than “practice makes perfect”	2
“Have a drink or smoke a joint.” Thanks, Chef. I’ll do both.	2
If you settle a lemon, a great cheesecake and a chocolate soufflé in a circle and chant "restauranteur" three times in a mirror, Wolfgang Puck will appear behind you.	1
I think its kinda cool that Elizabeth Haigh sent the tweet about nervous breakdowns the same month she opened her restaurant, and now that her question is being answered, she has a michellin star	2
I like that he mentioned the omelette thing. Many years ago I took culinary classes when I considered trying to become a chef, and an instructor I had emphasized the importance of a good omelette for restaurant interviews. Glad to know I wasn't led astray in that	2

Another great video, two 👍🏽 thumbs up. I know little to nothing about about motorcycle riding; nevertheless, the GCN team once again has brought another layer to overall world of cycling which for me makes even more interesting. Wishing the best for Scott & his team. 👍🏽	2
This was a fascinating look at something I love, by some genuinely interested people. I will add that you can build a significantly cheaper race bike, for a lower key series and still have fun on the track. I have a Minitwin which is relatively cheap to run, but a friend of mine has a litre plus missile and every time he crashes it, it costs about £5k and six months at least to fix! However, I far prefer long adventure rides to whizzing around the track, all of which you can do on a minitwin. 😁	2

Hanging onto my 8T for now. Curious to see what OnePlus does after the 10 overall coz the 9 & 10 didn't move me. They keep constantly moving from what made them great with each variant 😩, the OnePlus 6 being their last great phone	2
I’ve always wondered what it’s like for a tech reviewer to be constantly switching phones. Would love to see a how I set up my phone from a tech reviewer type video or something similar	1
I’m waiting for the Oneplus 10S or P or Q	2
Pretty happy with the oneplus 9. Camera is killer for sunny days on the beach. The oneplus carbon fiber case makes it feel excellent in the hand.	2
OnePlus have been making some solid looking hardware these days. That being said it does feel like they have been sort of trying to become the next Samsung with the number of phones that they have been launching.	2

Lots of profit negative tech startup companies with an over abundant of overpaid employees…..honestly who hasn’t seen this coming?	0
It's just usual trimming of the fluff when excess liquidity is withdrawn. It's important to do it before you get to the down rounds.  That way VCs can decide which baby chicks to feed and which ones to shove out of the nest.	1
What slowdown lol? It was abnormally fast and now with the recession, VCs realized many of these startups aren’t profitable so they laid off people. The big ones are still hiring and tech adoption isn’t nearly as much for it to slow down anytime soon.	0
I work in Cybersecurity. It hasn’t slowed down much because you can’t just stop securing your systems.	1
Slow hirings may be caused by a rapid rising labor cost in hi tech ind	0
That's really a problem with service economy. Most tech companies don't even produce a nail. They do things that are intangible, you cay easily live without them. If Netflix goes down I am sure there will not be any catastrophic event. If some manufacturing companies goes down, let's say the one that makes baby formula, it could trigger a panic.	0
"Startups and bitcoin tech? Definitely. Hiring freeze at big tech companies? Maybe/Nah. You still get regular churnovers that free up positions (especially now where ppl switch jobs every 2 yrs).

All in all pretty cool stuff. I like the Coolper I can really see that taking off. Huupe seems to be novelty. I can imagine the horror as soon as someone forgets there is a TV there and slams a ball only to shatter the device lol. The life straw actually works. Ive seen several science channels take pond water and view it under a microscope then filter it and view it again. It really does work but it does not filter out chemicals in the water, just microparticles and microbes."	2
I'm over this channel because 90% of the products they feature in their videos, are on Kickstarter, and honestly at this point they should change the name from, "Kick Starter"  to "Never Starter" LOL🤣😱🫣🤷🏾‍♀️, I'm just saying, as I'm also laughing my butt off, because that was hella funny, and it's also hella true, and yes it was also hella shady as well, sorry I couldn't help myself, anyway back to my point, because trust me it's a really good point, and just in case you're still laughing, let me get you back on track, so like I said 90% of the products featured on this channel and it's sister channel, or products that are on Kickstarter, and about 80% to 90% of the products on Kickstarter never even make it to market, that's right you read that correct, and my numbers are correct, because I did my research, so basically this channel, future tech and its sister channel, the future is now, both channels are useless, because over 90% of the products that they show you, you will never ever be able to purchase, so basically honestly it's a waste of everybody's YouTube time, unless you like looking at videos that feature products and gadgets, that will never come to market, and that you will never be able to purchase, seriously on being funny and sarcastic but also serious, because honestly I'm so over it and I'm over this channel, that's why I have unsubscribe and I'm telling everybody else to unsubscribe, so have you unsubscribed, please everybody unsubscribe, because at this point in time future tech and the future is now, and all those channels that display products that are on Kickstarter, and the keyword here is "display" because basically all the products are prototypes that are on display, and the public will never be able to buy them because they will never come to market, oh Kickstarter oops I'm sorry I mean never starter, oh my God I'm sorry I couldn't help myself because it's still so funny LOL, 🤣😂😭 but like I said these products never end up going to market and never end up being sold, so this whole useless channel is a waste of my time and your time and everybody else's time okay, now guess what... time's up so goodbye, and remember everybody please do yourself a big favor and unsubscribe!*🤷🏾‍♀️👍🏾👏🏾🤣😱🙊🙀🤯	2

It still blows my mind that companies have entire teams deciding whether or not a flavor is going to appeal to the masses, and yet somehow Swedish Fish flavored Oreos were still greenlit.	0
Interesting note: Real wasabi is difficult to cultivate and package and ship. It also grows only in a specific riverbank environment, which makes real wasabi expensive and in low supply. When young, real wasabi is a bit sweet not spicy. The "wasabi" that comes with your sushi dinner in America, it is most often just horseradish with green food coloring. This green-dyed horseradish replacing actual wasabi is known in the food world as an ersatz or a replica food.	1
That “section of the tongue” theory is so funny to me because it’s what I was taught as a fact in my high school anatomy class and I was trying to test that out on my own and never could, I would always taste every flavor no matter where it was in my mouth. I have never heard anyone say it wasn’t true so it’s cool to hear now	2
This woman is unbelievably amazing - I want a PhD in taste and I want her to be my professor - I’m a lawyer and after this ONE video I’m prepared to quit and pursue taste 😂	2
What she said about the packaging affecting the taste is so true! I always think delivery pizza smells so good, and it’s the pizza in the cardboard box that makes it smell amazing. Just not the same without the box 😆	2
"when I was a kid in kindergarten we did an experiment with that old fake 'five flavors' taste zones thing and I never got it. I could always taste everything on every part of my tongue.

Also, the amount of carbonation to syrup isn't set in the soda machines, and can be changed.  A soda with more carbonation is a 'dry' soda. A restaurant I loved would mix their own rootbeer syrup, and you could ask for it to be a dry or sweet, whichever was your preference.	2
Maybe it's because I know she's an audiologist but she annunciates everything beautifully and speaks with an even sound level. Like she clearly works with the hearing impared to naturally say every sound in a word to be heard as easily as possible	2
I’m so glad she talked about how hearing aids are more complicated than just a mic and speaker, as someone who has had two of them since I’ve been four I’ve had to explain that so many times (also having automatic Bluetooth ears is super cool)	2
My doctor also told me that our ears are self-cleaning. But when I pressured her for some off-the-record advice, she finally conceded that if I really.. REALLY.. felt the need to clean inside my ear canal, I could go ahead and use my elbows. I just adore my doctor!	2
Brilliant, well-spoken, well-enunciated, and a welcoming and animated face.  Great video!  I learned a lot.	2
The way I was hyped to to this!! I was born with hearing loss, so I had to see MANY audiologist in my life so far. People like her made my life so much easier. Her talking about hearing aids and clearing up misconceptions or even spreading knowledge made me smile ear to ear.	2
About earplugs at concerts - there are a variety of frequency-balanced earplugs that protect your hearing while preserving the sound quality of the music (Eargasm and Hearos are a couple of examples). I HIGHLY recommend them!	2
As someone who has been to many loud concerts and been in infantry, combat, and is now nearing 60, you should wear hearing protection whenever you can, same as sun protection for skin and sun glasses for your eyes.	1
Honestly, my main take away is that I've been saying "tinnitus" wrong my whole life.	0
Loved this as someone who previously studied to be an audiologist in the past. Also just love all of the "expert answers" videos on this channel. Thanks WIRED and Dr. Emily!	2
This was super fascinating, although the part about the ear drum being able to self repair was the most surprising to me.	2
The universal hate for printers is what unites humanity.	0
I suddenly gained immense amount of respect for Dyson after watching this.	2
I'm just shocked and saddened that they've ignored the most significant vacuum cleaner advance: the retractable cord.	0
You know you’ve made it in life when you can wear glasses like that with absolute conviction.	2
James Dyson is actually giving really good advice here. A lot of these types of Q&A's give really generic advice.	2
"""It's a printer""
Lol. Doesn't even matter what kind of printer, everyone can relate."	1
Probably the best interview/Answers so far. He leaps off the screen with his eloquent and articulate manner. It is very apparent that he is simply a genius.	2
This was so entertaining, I had no idea the person behind Dyson was a true, genuine and passionate inventor. And to see him speak so nicely about independent designers and the unfair problems they face was amazing!	2
"James Dyson: Makes legendary household appliances like vacums and hair dryers
Also James Dyson: Loves his cast aluminum pencil sharper.

I really wish we could see his full answers. I imagine this was a much longer video that had to be edited down. Release the directors’ cut!	1
Your videos make my weekend. It is something perfect that I can watch with my 4-year-old what we have lunch and it distracts him because his mom is leaving to work. Your videos honestly are lifesavers. Thank you	2
For the 50th video you should let AUSTIN choose a box 📦 🤷🏿‍♂️	1
8:58 I got the ReMarkable as a note taking/planner. Its has a great design. Really lightweight and better than carrying a note book or two. Subscription, depending who you are, are a hit a miss	2
Must admit, that new MX Master Mechanical keyboard looks and sounds great! Thinking of getting myself one of them now	2
This man really does love gundam. Respect.	2
Man the Grid Studios is my favorite tech. That is definitely something to get. I got it on my Christmas list this year. I like the remarkable until I see the price tag, that's the remarkable part they can get away with selling it for prices that rival apple products.	2
Jay had whole lotta energy on this video 🔥	2
As per usual, your unboxing videos make me  happy! Actually, all of them, thanks again!	2
I’ve been looking at those remarkable tablets for a few years now. I just can’t justify the price when I can carry an old school notebook lol	1
Thank you for the amazon voucher, great content as always!	2
Hey! By popular demand I made a list of all Cool Tech Under $50 products from the last 3 years archived so you can see it all on 1 page! https://lustre.ai/creator/randomfrankp	2
My favorite product was definitely the wireless desk charger. Hope I can finally win one of these. Love your videos Frank, keep up the great work!	2
On the wireless phone charger, I could see installing it under the wood in your nightstands if you have the right kind of furniture for the job. Also, the Echo Dot stand is super cute! Definitely made me think of Portal Turrets too!  Definitely my favorite!	2
Loved the “invisible” charger, would definitely contribute to keeping my clean.	2
Wow, that wireless desk charger is insanely cool. I would love one of those.	2
This channel is actually really cool. Instead of being just a kickstarter compilation these are all actual product reviews. Going to watch a few more before subscribing but so far extremely good channel	2
This might be the best episode of this series ever. So many great ideas!	2
The charger was my favorite. The hidden feature is cool but what I really like is the easy under the desk installation that also saves space	2
What an awesome video, I love to see new affordable products come out!  This makes me wonder why certain tech devices have such an immense shelf price.  If more technology can be produced at cheaper costs, there may be some advancement in the asking price from many everyday-used devices such as laptops or desktops	2
I love wireless setups and the wireless charger is always a bonus! Thanks for the best content as always!	2
Oh imagine when they get those sound wave extinguishers in giant sizes to catch the forest fires real quick. The people, animals and homes saved would be amazing. Not to mention the forests as well. What a brilliant invention. 😁👍☘️	2
That fire extinguisher could potentially be attached to drones to put out lightning strike fires and prevent future forest fires	1
Imagine we could just buy a sized sheet of film like a screen protector then place it on any window or surface we like , such as a mirror , bench top or car windscreen , and then be able to utilise it like a touch screen 👍 would be more practical than buying an expensive mirror	2
"In my opinion, despite my fascination for the topic, an exoskeleton is a an autonomous Robot built around the human shape with the purpose of giving its ""pilot"" (haha) a sense of being superior while executing lowest work dependent on the mood of it's programmer/superuser, replacing the pilot when needed and sending all his collectable data to the company that is worried about our future with the best intentions.

Floating cities sound pretty promising, as free land is already scarce. The question is who will rescue the cities from violent storms, or protect them from armed pirates. A floating city will need its own defenses, but will that be allowed within the 12 mile territorial limit?	1
It’s awesome, but what happens to the humans that used to do these jobs?	2
I want to know what problem that Quantum computer solved in a few minutes that would take a normal computer 10,000 years.	1
"AI is the most important one, a lot of people think AI is going to somehow mean self awareness, consciousness at some point.
The main implications of AI is that it is self improving, the true ramifications of this are not yet known but what is going to happen
is that AI is going to overtake humans in a lot of things, including research and science. It is going to snowball at some point and this is going to change
everything about life far more than the industrial era did. For  example, 300 years from now we can have an AI program that has been improving itself for 300 years.
We lose about 1.4 million people each year from car accidents, and that is just fatalities, there are also many more injuries. So while I understand people being
skeptical about machines driving cars, as time goes on it is not even going to be close, AI is going to be able to do many, many things better than humans.
At some point, these quantum computers are going to make AI, they could program an AI to make a better AI of itself, an improved version.
Then the 2nd one can make a 3rd one that is better then it, etc. etc.
There is really no telling what this is going to do because we are not there yet but it is going to change things very rapidly when it happens."	1
The claim about the quantum computer came and went. I'm not sure who is on top. I'd like to see more of the Chinese tech. We seem to have very little insight into what they are doing.	1
I can confirm her squirrel facts.  I raised an orphaned one, and it was the sweetest cuddliest pet until it almost grown.  Woke up one morning an she acted like a wild animal: biting, scratching, trying to eat my face off...  It was a sad day, but I've checked wanting a squirrel off my list!	0
Adore the collection of people you have answering questions. They are so intelligent in their respective subject and superbly passionate. Love learning more.	2
I swear to God, every "can I have this exotic pet" question can just be answered with the words "Do you know what 'domestication' is and how long it takes?"	0

"Declawing cats.
Stop calling it declawing, it has nothing to do with the claws.

THANK YOU for addressing declawing cats, and how awful and hurtful it is to the cat!	0
I have a cat who was declawed by a previous owner. He has so many behavioral issues that are typical of declawed cats. He was just at the vet yesterday for litter box issues and the vet brought up the fact that he was declawed. Declawing inflicts lifelong trauma on the animal.	0

Exotic animals as pets should be illegal. Tigers don't belong in farms, sugar gliders don't belong in apartments. Sad to see that this happens still.	0
If you decide to brush a cat's teeth, a fencing mask is highly recommended.	2
Let us know your tech queries using #AskGCNTech 👇	1
I had a recent fall at work and because I trained myself how to fall off a bike safely, I only had minor bruising on my butt. I did a tuck and roll like when I fall off the bike. Great advise Alex and Ollie.	2
When I got right hooked a few years ago, I only had time to think “this is gonna suck” and then proceeded to roll a ways on the pavement. Fortunately, I came away with ‘only’ bruises and road rash. Nothing got broken, and I think in part it was because I didn’t have a chance to put my hands out. Also, glad I was wearing a helmet!	2
I still have my copy of Eddie Borysewicz's "Bicycle Road Racing" (1985). In it he discusses practicing tumbling and diving somersaults in a gym to improve your crash response. Unfortunately I haven't practiced that, but my last inelegant dismount was at low speed, so only some skin lost.	1
#AskGCNTech after two years of running tubes, I finally went tubeless a couple of months ago. I managed to puncture my tyre the other day. Sealant didn’t do the trick nor did a couple of slugs - even tried a patch inside the tyre. The puncture was not on the sidewall and may have been 3mm large. Given the tire had plenty of life left, I am gutted that I may have to discard the tire now. When would you come to a decision that a tubeless tire is KO?	0
#askgcntech Riding in a strong crosswind the other day, I wondered if a high cadence would give a gyroscope effect and reduce buffeting from the wind.  Presumably from feet and shoes if so. Can Ollie show us the maths please.	1
My last crash (3 yrs ago).  I was on the ground so fast, I had no time to react or prepare for the impact.  But the scar from my collar bone repair looks pretty cool...	2
Another problem with filling tires with water is that the first bump you hit will probably cause the tire to blow off the rim.  Water is incompressible, unlike air, so it has to go somewhere when the tire volume gets changed due to an impact.	0
#AskGCNTech As a heavier rider, I feel I’m always in the max range of gears, either hardest gear on flat’sh roads or my easiest gear when I see any sustained gradients. I currently run a compact chain set with a 12-30 cassette on the rear. Would I benefit from upping my chain set to give me more usable gears or would this just make my climbing problem even worse due to the worse range at the rear	0
"I bought an old tractor to help clear the land I was building on. ""Stick with me."" 
I was towing a large log when I felt the back of my leg getting wet. No problem on the front of my trousers thank goodness. Turned out that a large sick had punctured one of the rear tires (tyres) 
Apparently it was fairly common practice to half fill the rear tyres (tires) with water to improve traction due to the added weight. Maybe sealant would be a better idea. Expensive though.
Love the show guys"	2

Having shot Canon for 20 years I switched the Nikon in 2016. Love both brands, but prefered the Nikon ergonomics with the dual command dials rather than the Canon methodology of the 4 buttons on the top plate. R5 really improved that but I love the ISOless nature of the Nikon sensors. Canon is getting better in that regard but still behind Nikon and Sony.	2
Hey Marques! I know these sound insignificant, but since you rarely update your little dongles/accessories that you carry around and your apps on your home screens, I think it would be interesting to get a little maybe quarterly series where you talk about any changes and what you'd like to see changed/simplified with those work flows. Just an idea!	2
@MKBHD I"m a photographer and use the Peak EDC V2.  I'm impressed you got a 16" into the 20L  I'm sure it's a snug fit and doesn't leave alot of room for a ipad too.  Wanted to give you a little tip I found on that bag, here goes: The main compartment has a pass through to the top zip area where phones, airpods, etc go.  You just have to fish a cable through the corner.  I do this by unzipping the side compartment enough to fish through the cable.  It makes it so I can leave a pass through USB travel battery charger with folding prongs, that means I plug in all my devices when they're in the zip area (laptop, phone, tablet and airpods) and they all get charge from the battery AND when I get to the hotel late, I just plug one one cable into the wall outlet and I hear all my devices chime in unison that they are now charging neatly in place.  Not only that when they're done charging the battery starts charging.  I wake up with everything ready to go.  Hope you enjoy trying this out. :)	2
Would love to see an EDC/daily tech for everyone else in The Studio!	2
Marques's reaction was genuine here. He was excited to know as what will come out of his bag next 🤪	2
"I went to check out the Opal camera because I need a webcam upgrade and it looked pretty legit. I loved everything I saw on the site up until the point of the $4/month fee to use their software?! on a $300 webcam?! I think I'll just get a capture card for my mirrorless or pick up a Logi webcam instead :/

other than that, nice tech kit.

Also, yeah, your experience with the Pixel 6 mirrors my past experience with Pixel phones. I got one to try something different to the iPhone and I loved it for a few months. I tried a few customizations but found that leaving it stock was generally the best experience for me. Then it started unexpectedly slowing down or apps would wig out and crash on me out of nowhere or the camera just wouldn't or it would reboot in the middle of doing something."	2
You are carrying great tech, and it makes total sense that you are rellying more and more on Apple, their ecosystem is really good. I am an Android user and don't stick to just one brand but my wife is All-Apple and she really likes how seemless everything is. Cool stuff Marques.	2
Hey Marques, can you do an updated “The Ecosystem explained” I think a lot of viewers would appreciate a video not only for Apple side of the ecosystem but also Android, seeing as though a lot of new products are coming out in support for easy use for Androids. Love all your videos btw! 🖤	2
I can see that exoskeleton helping people with limited mobility in the future. It's a marvelous piece of tech. Thanks for giving us a glimpse of things to come!	2
the exoskeleton probably wouldn’t be affordable for everyone to use, and may have long term effects, but i think it would be amazing for rehabilitation and other medical related use!	2
I've got that Azeron keypad. HIGHLY recommend it for all kinds of applications where quickness is ideal, but especially for gaming. Highly highly. You can even find certain models on Amazon usually. I ordered mine from the factory, for the color scheme and one of the newer designs. (the one on this video is the original design, which I'm sure is still just as phenomenal, but my fingers twitch randomly sometimes, so having the buttons above the knuckle could have been a problem.	2
The game pad that you highlighted actually is already available. I am a right arm amputee and also a big gamer and was considering buying it but it’s over $200 US and you would still need a mouse. Also I have already become very proficient using a standard controller for gaming already and mostly mostly use an Xbox controller for my PC so I decided it wasn’t worth it. But it’s still a very good design in my opinion and I would love to see how it feels to use irl just not at that price point lol.	2
Cyborg game controller looks pretty neat. I am from from Latvia and that company makes pretty high end gaming gear (expensive too).	2

My husband and I have been able to minimal, conscious in spending, saving and investing wisely, I now earn every week. You're such a blessing to this generation, we all love you	2
Wow imagine having the ability to determine the weather simply by looking out the window, what a world we are living in.	1
Man, to think one day I might be able to own a dehumidifier and a battery. Wow.	2
Yes, the game pad is incredibly convenient, but incredibly expensive so seemingly lower quality production  than it's competitors, that being said I would sure love to have one.	2
"When someone tells a lie,

When you as an employee are fired from a company and the reasons they are giving you are “poor performance, or lack of culture fit”, trust me when I tell you the real reasons are not disclosed. Been there, done that. Companies lie, HR works for the company and also lies, and a corporation hierarchy matters. When you lawyer up is when they start taking you a bit more seriously.	0

It's almost impressive how many LTT employees even with a $5k upgrade have the jankiest setups I have ever seen.	2
Just a note on the screw driver. Put some "extended" bits with it or a smaller precision screw driver in the set with it.  Its very common for some screws to be deep in a hole and having those small bits into hex end wont go in far enough down the hole to extract screw. I see this allot on Laptops, controllers that kinda thing. Sunk in screws suck.	0
"At this point I think that the whole point of labs was to fill it with more employees so that we never run out of Intel tech upgrades 

I will buy as many screwdrivers as it takes to pay their salaries plz just give me more Intel extreme tech upgrades"	1
LTT Extreme Tech Upgrades will never not be absolutely funny and (somewhat) informative :)	2
I think one of the things I love the most about these intel extreme upgrades is Linus learning and getting angry at his employees for everything about their lives.	2
This episode has me cracking up hard! Love the rabbit hole that Nick has gone down with the keyboard mods. Respect.	2
I love how even Linus doesnt want to fit all those hard drives in in a such a jank way. Im with you Linus, I'll do a lot to make things easier but thats a bit too far XD	2
I love his space. It's messy, full of things that he could throw away if he really went through it all, but it's a catalog of and container for life as he's living it rather than just a show piece.	2
After seeing the macro pad I was checking out their website and loved all their products. I've wanted a product like this for when I stream to make it easier, and this here is just what I need. It's a great product and I'd love it for my setup.	2
Very surprised with this month's list, considering how every single item in the list feels like it could go with my setup or just seems super cool to me. Usually there's one or two items that I don't think I'd personally find useful, but I am 100% adding all these items to my wishlist!	2
I absolutely loved the Hoto laser measuring tool. As an engineering student, I am constantly measuring objects and like using various rulers. I would love to own one of these Hoto laser measuring tools for sure! Also, this months list particularly caught my eye, as everything listed seems like something I would want to purchase in the near future.	2
So many great products on this list! These are all incredibly practical too, especially the macropad. The abililty to customize literally every aspect of it is killer.	2
The Hoto laser was a pretty good change of pace, loved it. Feels very complementary to the theme of office gadgets! Keep em coming! Ideas: specific under-desk drawers, and other more “furniture” alike stuff that will make your setup noice.	2

Just discovered your channel and the series. Going to be watching your older ones today while working. That macro pad is really cool. That would definitely be something I'd pick up and use.	2
That macropad looks killer! Been looking for a segue into custom keyboards for a while and that seems like a great place to start. Looks like it would be incredibly useful for both work and personal applications too which is a huge plus. Would love to have one in the near future!	2
I’ve actually been looking for macro pads recently and you just upload the very thing I needed! I love that you can customize it to fit your aesthetic, truly a must have for any setup	2
That macropad looks so 🔥 love the customisation of it all!	2

Great to see you including a wider variety of stuff in these videos beyond just electronic devices, especially the pharmaceutical industry.

This is a common misconception. While part of the reason was the battery being too thin, the main issue was a manufacturing defect in the corner of most of the batteries at launch, which was a tiny dent in the top (left?) corner. This would cause the battery to eventually short out, as the dent caused both terminals to eventually touch each other. Most people's phones were exploding while fast charging, which was likely due to the increased power going through the battery, and lithium-ion batteries do not take well to being shorted out like that.

Edit: Normally defects of that scale would be perfectly fine, and would never cause issues, but they made the battery too thin, meaning it shorted it out easier. Just wanted to clarify that."	0
I now know I like this guy. I at first thought I had some type of prejudicial dislike of him maybe because he was too smooth and that goes against my grain but I love this guy because he does seem to care about things and many of them seem not to be regarding how much money he can make off of a ad for a person it seems as his reviews are sincere and these seem not to have to do with what I've seen only from him which is technology I really love the fact that this guy cares about people's safety and he brings up some safety issues which people should be concerned about if they have children especially with the toys and the baby monitors yeah this guy is getting a big a+ from me.	2

MY FINANCIAL GOAL IS TO BE MAKING AT LEAST UP TO $1,000,000 EVERY YEAR BY INVESTING HEAVILY BOTH IN CRYPTO AND STOCK. I NEED GUIDIANCE. please comment below....	1
Can definitely vouch for the Switch grip. I used to never play handheld mode because of how uncomfortable it was. Now I do it all the time with the grip!	2
Dude! that battery swap alone would sell me over the Sony H9, Steelseries hit it hard with that feature! I wish more peripherals had that ability!	2
It's a great month for tech with a lot of cool and reliable products. Love em all!	2
I gotta admit, that SteelSeries Headset is next level! Also the Switch grip being under $20 is a steal.	2
The Oivo grip is amazing! Have one for my V2 switch as well	2
The music in the background is just a classic for this channel! Love it!	2
Grover also lets you buy products if you keep renting every month until it reaches retail price. Realy like that laptop keep renting until it you've paid the equivalent of retail and its yours. Easy payment plan type vibes.	1
Yes, for your sponsor Grover. If you keep renting a product until you reach its retail price, you can keep it forever for a symbolic dollar. Or, if you fall in love with an item before that, you can also pay it off at any point. So the only issue I find with that is why must we have to pay retail for a refurbished  or used item?	1
Best part about the Novas is being able to use the switch with it since it has BT. I go from PC, play some ps5, then go off the grid with the switch all on one headset. It’s amazing.	2
When we moved to home working I got the Logitech MX Master 3, it’s been great as an all round mouse, I miss my setup when I have to go back i to the office lol. Although I could just take my mouse with me.	2
I love this series, the experts are not judgemental and very professional.	2
For those who are curious: Not only is it widely accepted that an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs, but we also know exactly WHERE the asteroid landed: it's called the Chicxulub crater. It's located on the northern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula and has been carbon-dated to have formed in that time period, and it size of the crater certainly looks catastrophic enough.	0
Such innocence when he reads “godstiddies”. He is adorable.	2
I would absolutely love to attend a paleontology course that guy was running. His enthusiasm is infectious.	2
the way he factually states "the world is a sphere" makes you feel like he's heard even weirder statements before and this is just another misconception he corrects 😅	0
"""Since when were pterodactyls not dinosaurs?""

""Since ever"" That is probably one of the greatest answers"	2
Hearing this guy stay professional while reading the Username "Godstiddies" was the highlight of my day.	2
That was cool. I like that he said Jurassic Park was for entertainment not science. I often hear people complaining that things like Jurassic Park aren't scientifically accurate. Who cares. I watch that kind of stuff to be entertained. If I want to learn something I'll watch a documentary which I also do.	2
The fact that birds are technically dinosaurs is a fact that would have blown my mind as a kid. Which is why I try to bring it up with kids as often as I can! Growing up, Plesiosaurus was my favorite “dinosaur”, although it’s technically not a dinosaur. My other favorites are Maiasaura and Parasaurolophus	2
You can always tell when someone enjoys their job.  He is so enthusiastic and knowledgeable about dinosaurs.  What a great series.	2
The biggest problem is colleges charging outrages tuition fees, causing this to happen	0
So everyone who couldn’t afford college will have to pay for those who did……why not make college affordable in the first place?	0
Now we need to cap these institutions. No more predatory pricing!! Honestly these colleges/universities should be paying back people the interest as well. (those who have and have not paid off their loans, last 30 years included.	0
Today I learned “low income families” make up to 250k per year.	1
Regulate college tuition so that this doesn’t happen again please. Otherwise this will be pointless	0
My question is , if you are in public service for the 10 years, is the 120 qualifying payments still a requirement under this new announcement.	1
When colleges knew about this, watch them charge more tuition. Then you will know why college is expensive in the first place.	0
He needs to find a way to get schools to lower their tuition rates and quit trying to game a broken student loan system. This will just keep happening and its not going to stop idealistic young people from taking out massive debt on a useless degree. The schools need to be REGULATED. If they take govt funds, then they should be subject to immediate regulation.	0
The states deregulated tuition and fees so the colleges could charge more. Then, they used that money to hire more administrators and build more buildings. The students are not just paying for their education. They are also paying for all the things the colleges wanted, but the states did not want to give them money for. Nobody talks about that.	0
There is no such thing as loan cancellation, its merely a transfer... Do people not understand how this works?	0

I'm trying to hold onto hope and positivity for New York State, but every year it gets harder and harder!	0
Nadler shouldn't be allowed to drive much less wield power.	0
This is a good way to get rid of career politicians from one party by putting them both in the against each other meaning one of them will be gone at least	1
Funny how democrats always choose the old white man lol	0

I feel for civilians that just want to live a peaceful normal life in Ukraine...	0
to be clear it's not alleged war crimes they have tried and convicted people for them already so yes war crimes are being committed in Ukraine just because you don't like saying it doesn't change that its actually happening to the people it affects.	0
"I whole heartedly agree with the guy from NATO who was saying that Europe and the US will pay a high price this winter for supporting Ukraine this winter, but not supporting them will cost us even more

The biggest threat to Ukraine right now is that the rest of us will lose interest and abandon them
Ukraine needs to get all their territory back or Russia is just going to eat them in bites and then they will move to the next nation that they want to add back to the Soviet Union"	0
"Happy Independence Day to Ukraine and glory! 
🇮🇸❤️🇺🇦
The reason why I support Ukraine, because I’m human and I support human rights and if Ukraine surrenders, there will be no more Ukraine and it won’t save lives. It will only end up in a brutal occupation like Bucha, irpin and Mariupol massacre. The main goal of Russia is that they want to destroy Ukraine as a nation, just like Rome destroyed Carthage. Russians don’t treat Ukrainians as people."	0
He thought it would take him 3 days to take over all of Ukraine. It's been 6 months, and he barely took a small part of the East and South - and even there, Ukraine from time to time take some sections back. Ukraine deserves most of the credit - they have proven themselves not just brave and tenacious, but also skilled, capable. The West deserves the rest of the credit. Putin actually managed to unite us...	1
"Putin is the greatest gift to NATO since the end of the cold war". Now thats funny!	2
