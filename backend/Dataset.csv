"@MKBHD I""m a photographer and use the Peak EDC V2.  I'm impressed you got a 16"" into the 20L  I'm sure it's a snug fit and doesn't leave alot of room for a ipad too.  Wanted to give you a little tip I found on that bag, here goes: The main compartment has a pass through to the top zip area where phones, airpods, etc go.  You just have to fish a cable through the corner.  I do this by unzipping the side compartment enough to fish through the cable.  It makes it so I can leave a pass through USB travel battery charger with folding prongs, that means I plug in all my devices when they're in the zip area (laptop, phone, tablet and airpods) and they all get charge from the battery AND when I get to the hotel late, I just plug one one cable into the wall outlet and I hear all my devices chime in unison that they are now charging neatly in place.  Not only that when they're done charging the battery starts charging.  I wake up with everything ready to go.  Hope you enjoy trying this out. :)",2

This is a common misconception. While part of the reason was the battery being too thin, the main issue was a manufacturing defect in the corner of most of the batteries at launch, which was a tiny dent in the top (left?) corner. This would cause the battery to eventually short out, as the dent caused both terminals to eventually touch each other. Most people's phones were exploding while fast charging, which was likely due to the increased power going through the battery, and lithium-ion batteries do not take well to being shorted out like that.

Edit: Normally defects of that scale would be perfectly fine, and would never cause issues, but they made the battery too thin, meaning it shorted it out easier. Just wanted to clarify that.",0

It's not like someone tripped you up before getting a touchdown. The game is literally over, all you do is hold onto the ball for a couple seconds and that's it. The Washington Wizards were up by 3 at that point. Even if the apposing team has time to foul you, you hit just 1 free throw and it's over. Even if you miss both, they have to somehow rebound the ball and go for a full court shot to TIE the game in an impossible amount of time... Long story short, that throw lost them the game after OT lol... Just look at his fellow teammates staring at him in total disbelief afterwards. Gotta be one of the worst throws in sports history.",0

"3 games in to the season might seem like a bit too soon to be worried about this Liverpool team but, the early indications are that the Liverpool midfield is literally paper thin when it comes to resources. As a long time LFC supporter I can't help but compare the decision to let Sadio Mane go to the same situation with Xavi Alonso some years back. I think that J. Klopp is going to have to put in some serious time working with this squad to get anywhere close to a top 4 position this year. Hope I am wrong but, if I am being honest Man. Utd should have been 4-0 up at halftime.",0

"A decisive battle between civilization and savagery has begun. Even in the Second World War it was not like that. Because the two savages were on different sides of the front. It was an inter-German showdown: the Germano-Slavic ethnic  of the Deutschs against the Germano-Celtic French and the English, and the Russian savagery was either together with the savagery of the Deutschs or against them. Now the front line has clearly been drawn between civilization and savagery. I see the philosophical law of contradiction: civilization is definitely a positive phenomenon, but it is mixed with negativity in the form of shame and cowardice: civilization has hid behind Ukraine and is waiting for something unknown. The memory of civilization's victory in this war will be tainted with the memory of shame.",1

"AI is the most important one, a lot of people think AI is going to somehow mean self awareness, consciousness at some point.
The main implications of AI is that it is self improving, the true ramifications of this are not yet known but what is going to happen
is that AI is going to overtake humans in a lot of things, including research and science. It is going to snowball at some point and this is going to change
everything about life far more than the industrial era did. For  example, 300 years from now we can have an AI program that has been improving itself for 300 years.
We lose about 1.4 million people each year from car accidents, and that is just fatalities, there are also many more injuries. So while I understand people being
skeptical about machines driving cars, as time goes on it is not even going to be close, AI is going to be able to do many, many things better than humans.
At some point, these quantum computers are going to make AI, they could program an AI to make a better AI of itself, an improved version.
Then the 2nd one can make a 3rd one that is better then it, etc. etc.
There is really no telling what this is going to do because we are not there yet but it is going to change things very rapidly when it happens.",1

Now that the next gen has seen the effects, they are only taking logical next steps to ensure their own security. Universities is just way too expensive...on top of that, theres cost of housing and food and transportation. If it were more affordable, I truly believe more kids absolutely would go.

"Back in 2018 when John Oliver did the episode on Corporate Consolidation it inspired me so much that I applied for a Masters of Research program, got into a program, and did my entire research thesis on tech oligopolies. It was shocking to see how bad it really is; oligopolies that bordered in monopolies are rampant. My research essentially focused on the question of whether lack of enforcement of our antitrust laws caused this whole problem or whether lack of adequate laws were the core of the issue. The answer was that it was truly both. I thoroughly enjoyed my pre-doctoral masters thesis and am considering a PhD in the future. It's so lovely to see John talk about this, specifically on the tech sector!

Edit: Wow! Thanks everyone for the great comments! I haven't published it yet, otherwise I would share it with all you lovely people ❤ I am now looking for a policy or qualitative research/analyst job so if anyone is hiring, let me know 😅",0

For ones like Tierney, Tomiyasu, and Smith Rowe who were main starters for Arsenal last season, we will definitely need their contribution more as the season goes by. I hope they can be patient, grab the opportunities, and show what they are capable of on the pitch as the season keep going on. Compared to the last season, this is a huge improvement. The squad depth is so much thicker that we are using Tomiyasu, Smith Rowe, and Tierney as substitutes.

"For the platform game, I think the second go was almost perfect. If he found a way to obscure his hands and ask a loaded question, then it would’ve been foolproof. Like if he kept a coin and hid it somewhere on his person, then asked everyone which hand held the coin. That’s not a perfect solution, but that’s the kind of question I’m thinking of.

"From my point of view, the selection of Varane is decisive.
When the defense lacks solidity, all areas of the game suffer. His presence and the quality of his interventions gave confidence to the whole team, including Martinez, who was also much more efficient.
I wonder if in reality Varane is not the man of the match even without being the best on the field.

Get the bare minimum you need and only spend money on products you know you are going to be using for 4-6 years (such as laptop). Don't overspend on phone, headphones, lamps, tablets, etc.",1

"Hi just want to say that many times ruminating is emotionally driven… there can be an uncomfortable feeling and our mind jumps in to try to either make us feel better or dwell on that feeling and feed more into it.  So shifting from our mind and into our body sensations can actually be really helpful and grounding and even illuminating.  When we ignore our feelings our body often starts shouting at us to get our attention, so just listening to what our body is saying, acknowledging the feelings and fears, can be very clarifying and soothing.",1

"I bought an old tractor to help clear the land I was building on. ""Stick with me."" 
I was towing a large log when I felt the back of my leg getting wet. No problem on the front of my trousers thank goodness. Turned out that a large sick had punctured one of the rear tires (tyres) 
Apparently it was fairly common practice to half fill the rear tyres (tires) with water to improve traction due to the added weight. Maybe sealant would be a better idea. Expensive though.
Love the show guys",2
"I can confirm her squirrel facts.  I raised an orphaned one, and it was the sweetest cuddliest pet until it almost grown.  Woke up one morning an she acted like a wild animal: biting, scratching, trying to eat my face off...  It was a sad day, but I've checked wanting a squirrel off my list!",0

"I certainly remember being much better at being creative when I was younger, but now that I'm a freshman in High School, I've noticed that I'm much worse at the whole creativity thing. Now, the problem is, I'm being praised. Why? I am great at finding the one answer. I can take tests very well, but am typically not the best at projects. Math is my best subject, English is my worst, where you typically have to write creative essays. I want to be an engineer, so at my school, we have an elective called pre-engineering. It's one of the closest classes to an actual job that's available at my school. And I'm not the best at it. Sure I can do the math required, but coming up with ideas for better designs is hard. I feel that this shows that my education is doing the opposite of preparing me for the future. It's telling me that there's one answer, which is never the case in engineering. I hope that soon enough we can have an education overhaul, and realize that we need to change education.",0
"I did not expect to love this video as much as I did... it epitomizes the very best of YouTube in my opinion - a well-made video with a well-constructed narrative, hosted flawlessly and provides a genuinely good service to everyone, even if they are not in the market for these products.

I have a cat who was declawed by a previous owner. He has so many behavioral issues that are typical of declawed cats. He was just at the vet yesterday for litter box issues and the vet brought up the fact that he was declawed. Declawing inflicts lifelong trauma on the animal.,0
"I have a high paying tech job that I’m about to leave. I feel incredibly blessed and privileged to have had it, even though I worked hard to get to where I am. I was promoted very fast after 5 years. I know it’s something many people would love to have and honestly I’m happy that someone else who has worked hard will get my spot. Ultimately I became burnt out and just need some time to reset my life. I have lived humbly, saved every thing I could, paid off debts as quickly as possible, and have enough to live for 8 months to a year. I’m hoping to come back into the industry as a healthier employee or have found something else fulfilling.

For anyone wishing they had one of these jobs or feel frustrated by people that appear to be complaining, I hope you achieve your dream and get one. You can do it, keep at it! Taking one of these jobs to be financially secure is a blessing. I am taking a break because my mental health and stress hospitalized me (don’t let that scare you, I just have my own personal stuff too 😄).",2
"I have ADHD so usually it's hard for me to focus on talks, speeches and so on.

I have to say it after watching this video it feels like the journey you're on this year has been effective. It simply feels like you're enjoying life and its what I enjoy most about watching your videos. You manage to pass that joy on. Just the musings of a random stranger. 😀,2
"I have used Galaxy Tab S7 during my Ph.D. It's been a lifesaver for me. First of all, it is really good for reading journals, note taking and scribbling on the pdf's, secondly, it doesn't strain your eye that much when you use a computer or a laptop always at a fixed distance, thirdly you get the premium version of noteshelf free with Tab s7 and lastly if you are from a STEM background and use a lot of illustrations or flow process diagrams, you can draw those easily with the stylus on Tab s7. I choose tab s7 over Apple Ipad Air for its ease of use, user interface, and cost (you get stylus for free with Tab S7 and in most cases keyboard too with a huge student discount).",2

I buy 3~4 games per year at most and usually heavily discounted. Quality multiplayer games are a rarity nowadays, CoD and Battlefield lost their way. Quality single player games are still a thing but are often filled with bugs on release so i wait it out and buy GoTY editions usually and often second hand (gotta love disc edition systems). I refuse to fuel bad descions made by money hungry devs or publishers.",0

I honestly can feel the pain without being the one in pain😬.,1
I honestly feel like COD MW on did it best on Xbox 360. Achievements for single player and challenges for multiplayer. That was 2007. Now I’m 34 with a wife and kids. It’s almost unimaginable trying to do 100% a game with multiplayer supporting a family and working.,2
"I honestly have to say, while its still insanely expensive, 3500 for that monitor isn't as bad as I was expecting. And its almost 'reasonable'. Like, its still more than I would ever spend on a single display, and I'm far more into having separate displays but, given what its capable of, the specs, the tech behind it etc. its not that bad. I can see a few people getting real use out of something like that,.",2
"I honestly think Marques should start a gaming channel, only so we can appreciate him ""enjoying"" his tech in the way most people will do. Being very analytical and knowledgeable about tech is a great benefit to those who come to this channel, but there is a slight otherworldliness to seeing some talk about tech in a matter of fact way and not seeing them actually use it in a real world environment and showing that they actually enjoy the thing they are criticising...which to be fair no one with sense would think he doesn't enjoy his tech but seeing it would be a great addition.",2

"I know at least 5 ways to deal with them:

1. Never take their words personally. Always have this suspicion in mind, that they do not wish good for you, so you shouldn't trust their opinion of you.
2. Don't compete with them. It is futile and drains your energy.
3. If they attack you, stay calm, indifferent and if possible give them a sneaky compliment. The odds are they are used to people attacking them back and it takes them off guard when you see the positive things in them rather than the negative.
4. Don't become them. If they are negative, be positive. If they lie, tell the truth. If they speak behind your back, speak to their face. Always lead with example, because they might not simply have the skills to do that.
5. Do not trust them. Don't tell them personal details about your life or things they could use against you. Keep your distance and value your boundaries. Protect yourself.",0

"I like her approach and It's partly right but I do believe that the things that we want to do during the week could be postponed for other reasons too and not only because we don't count them as priorities. For example,  it's not the same having free time in the morning and having free time at 23:00. The opportunities for doing certain things are less (kids are in bed, shops are closed etc.) Also, when you want to meet other people you need to find some hours in which you are both free and it's not super easy to happen",1

I love the fact that you put “Thinnest Rick Roll” and “Can you legally employ a cat” on the search history even if it flashed on the screen for a second. You are one of the only creators that put 100% effort and detail into their content. Keep it up!,2

Back then I never really thought much of it. But now that I’m in college, being exposed to a more western type of education system made me question this kind of practice. It never helpd me improve my academic. I was always dead last in class. All it ever did to me was lowering my self confidence and give me anxiety. I'm never going back to those times.",0

I now know I like this guy. I at first thought I had some type of prejudicial dislike of him maybe because he was too smooth and that goes against my grain but I love this guy because he does seem to care about things and many of them seem not to be regarding how much money he can make off of a ad for a person it seems as his reviews are sincere and these seem not to have to do with what I've seen only from him which is technology I really love the fact that this guy cares about people's safety and he brings up some safety issues which people should be concerned about if they have children especially with the toys and the baby monitors yeah this guy is getting a big a+ from me.,2

"I personally enjoy the old school phones.  I have such a hard time hearing my iPhone at max volume without the speaker on.  If I worked in an office I would definitely buy one.  People forget how ergonomic those old phones are.  It's not particularly comfortable holding a rectangle to your head.  I also have physically sensitive ears so any type of headphones, ear phones, whatever... cause me a bunch of pain.  Looks like a good product that can both be a gag and something for people out there like me who have a tough time using a regular mobile phone.",2

"I really believe in everything he has just said. It is important to avoid procrastination guys. I am telling you this because of my life experience. I moved to Canada when I was 20 years old and my life has changed completely. I was studying computer engineering in my home country and was about to complete my 3rd year when my mother took the decision to move to Canada. It was really difficult at the beginning because of the language and culture. My knowledge about English was probably between 30% and 45%, so I had to invest part of time studying English.  I proposed to myself that I had to learn the language  at a university level  in 1 year, and it worked. I still need improvements, but I feel really proud of myself because I was able to learn the language. After having learned English, I applied to University of Toronto to study Computer Science,  and since the semester was going to start on September of the following year, I took that year to study everything about my career. I took my time to study advanced functions, calculus, physics and programming. What do I mean about all of this? You can learn everything you want if you really want to. The crucial part of all of this is to believe that you can do it. I personally do not believe in what the science says about the ""SPECIAL KIDS"". We all are smart beings that have the same capacities to learn everything we want. You can do it guys if you are willing to take the effort. I hope you have a great day and I wish you all the best ☺️. NEVER GIVE UP.",1

I remember I was in an argument with a friend if mine and I crossed my arms. She instantly called me out on it and said if I'm being open and honest then why did I cross my arms. Thats a defensive stance. Later I found out that this was meant and a self sooth which I find more realistic. That situation was stressful for me so crossing my arms made sense I do that when I'm anxious or upset,1

"I think it’s so silly that Netflix feels the need to compete with YouTube and TikTok. I think these platforms should be able to exist together in harmony as they each offer very different products.

People also don’t typically like when YouTubers are given a large budget like with YouTube Red originals, so Netflix buying out certain YouTubers is not the right idea…",0

other than that, nice tech kit.

Also, yeah, your experience with the Pixel 6 mirrors my past experience with Pixel phones. I got one to try something different to the iPhone and I loved it for a few months. I tried a few customizations but found that leaving it stock was generally the best experience for me.

"I wish developers would realize that forced DRM and Internet connectivity for games is a step backward. Look at the debacles GT7 and SimCity have endured; what's the point of paying a full $70 for the game if there is no guarantee you can play it at your leisure, especially if this ridiculous requirement is in place for SINGLE-PLAYER modes?

In my opinion, at that point, you can't help but wonder if spending time with the game is either fun or just another full time job. This is not why people play games.",0

"I worked a low paying tech job for six years and still felt the burn out. The problem is that tech is very fast paced and competition focused. You can barely keep up. Though I got promoted regularly, my higher ups told me the truth before they left, they said that I was severely underpaid based on my skills (essentially I branded myself a one stop shop for the marketing department as I am both technically knowledgeable, people oriented and strategic). I maxed out at $50K. So I decided to jump ship with little planned. Now I run a financial agency with my husband and we make $250K a year as entrepreneurs and we have the freedom to set our own lifestyle.",0

"I would like to argue that declaring you quit the death game and that the girlfriend can save herself is perhaps the worst way to test the game master in that situation. Yes, figuring out a way to determine why the game master is helping you is a good idea, but if the only reason they're helping you is because they're impressed with your selflessness/willingness to risk your life to save hers/they have a connection to the girlfriend, then say goodbye to your main advantage in this game. I'm not sure if there is a good way to definitively figure out their motivations in one declaration/action, but you could run some tests over time to see which actions get rewarded and make more declarations as to your own ""motivations"" to see if that has any effect, but make them less obvious and less likely to cause the game master to completely abandon you.",1

Suddenly it turned out it DIDN'T cost $300 to connect to unlimited internet, you could get that for $80!",1

"I've been around for every console generation.  I remember thinking during the Genesis/Turbografx era (SNES not out quite yet) what games would be like when I was old, and the kind of specs they would need.  Obviously I had no idea what the specs really meant back then, but I was thinking ""256-bit"" lol.  (as for the CPU, and 64-bit is all we really need for that)  They have happily progressed faster than I had imagined, looking just as good today, if not better, then I imagined things would look like 20~25 years from now.  The 1990's and early 2000's with the massive clock speed increases and the advent of the GPU were the main things that took us to where we are, hardware wise.",2

"In my experience, burnout comes from realizing that improved performance doesn't produce improved rewards, it produces more work. The response to a job well done is never a couple days off or a timely bonus, instead good work is ""rewarded"" with the demand for twice as much work in the same amount of time. Firms see young workers as a productivity sponge to be squeezed for all it's worth, young people are almost never treated as the company's future.",0

it's not always that you want an unlimited dataset in machine learning. Sometimes you want to limit your dataset. For example if you're trying to figure out if you're in a stock market recession or expansion you don't want to go over 2 years (+- months) of data because you'll end up in another cycle. Symmetry and Domain limits are important in machine learning. My point is sometimes too much data is a waste of time and resources,0

"Just a note on the screw driver. Put some ""extended"" bits with it or a smaller precision screw driver in the set with it.

I see this allot on Laptops, controllers that kinda thing. Sunk in screws suck.",0

Loved the season opener look back. As a kid who went the games with my Pops. He worked at BYU his entire career. 40 years+ always had season tickets. My Dad passed away last October with a long painful battle with cancer. With all the ugly evil things going on on the world. BYU football & Basketball was our time to just hangout and enjoy being together. Although my Dad was a little to crazy dealing with traffic and parking 😆😆,2

"My mother used my “successes” as her gauge to show approval and basic humanity. It was never enough for her to show love, only maybe enough to prevent the threats of leaving or avoid hearing that I was a complete failure. Take it from me, don’t push your children towards your goals; it only teaches them that they aren’t good enough to make it on their own. I was “successful” in school and was the first in my family to get a degree, but I was also the most miserable, sad child of all 10 of us kids. Is that success? I know it isn’t.",0

My son is a senior in high school this year. He says he might choose community college but doesn't want a 4 year university. Trade school is fine too. I think he just doesn't know what he wants to do with his life yet and that's okay. I went to college and spent 12 years paying it off just to decide later that social work was not for me. I don't understand why kids have to rush into a lifelong career when they haven't even had the opportunity to live life yet. I want my child to explore different career paths before he chooses one. I'm in no rush to kick him out. All I ask is that he works or goes to school. I don't want him to be out on his own until he has money saved in the bank and a stable job. I want him to know how to budget and manage his finances properly. I don't want him to struggle living paycheck to paycheck trying to make ends meet. He can go to college anytime if he chooses to do so. There's no age limit.,0

"Points that were missed: 

- Apple arguably has a specific Monopoly in the US with smartphones because of iMessage not being open with other multi-platform messaging apps. This weirdly only applies in the States. The rest of the world favours things like WhatsApp and Facebook messenger ( both owned by meta, Which is its own issue). That's probably the main defence Apple will bring up. 

- they've been in trouble before but don't forget about Microsoft, Windows 11 has seen them go back to some of their old tricks like a favouring their own software and making it difficult to remove. 

- this kind of got glossed over but although Google play takes the same cut for purchases as Apple, you are free to install other app stores and install apps from wherever you like, so they avoid the heat there. Google play is still the most preferred store on Android phones, so Google likely takes advantage of that fact in promoting its own software.",1

"Quality player is Casemiro & also a DM which we've cried out for. The concern with this signing though is how much more motivation will he have to still achieve having won everything multiple times over at Madrid? We are said to pay him an eye-popping 400k a week is what I've heard & that's typical United, one of our biggest problems has been paying insane wages resulting in comfortable, unmotivated players who we then can't move on when it's time. As I say, quality player but just seems like one that may help to stabilise us a bit more again but won't helps us achieve anything substantial. As for Pulisic, I've always been quite underwhelmed by him, albeit you can see he does possess good quality. I probably wouldn't be averse to a loan though, it can't be any worse than banging our heads against a brickwall hoping Rashford does anything productive every week.",0

"Realizing that no matter what happens, I'll be okay, is exactly how I survived my childhood. I used to stress so much then after so many dramatic plot twists, I realized if I survived all that, I will survive whatever else comes my way and that's when I stopped stressing as much. I hadn't really connected it with confidence before but I can see the connection now. Interesting. 🤔",2

"Regarding Cans vs. Bottles: At least in Germany the bottle is more environmentally friendly, since they get used again and again. You bring the empty bottles to the local grocery shop, they then get sent to a cleaning plant, where they pressurewash the bottles inside and out with steaming hot water. Afterwards they get reused for beer. The size and shape of most bottles is according to a standard, so different brewers use the same bottles.

It's far less energy intense than smelting and remanufacturing cans.",1

"Something important to know, for all who are interested in history and/or support Ukraine: 

Rus’ ought not to be confused with “Russia”, which derives its name from the Rus’ but historically is a completely different state, which almost all its existence was at war with the Rus’. 

Just like the Holy Roman Empire was actually Germany, Russia is actually Muscovy, despite their best attempts to convince everybody otherwise. 

Its name “Russia"" received only in 1721, when Peter I passed a decree to change Tsardom of Muscovy’s name into the “Russian” Empire (“Russia” originates from Rosia, name used by the Greek Orthodox Clergy in regards to Kyivan Rus')
Under the reign of Cathrine II Muscovites where even punished for continuing to identify as Muscovites, and were forced to call themselves “Russian”. 

Lands that “Russia” claims were part of the original Rus’, but actually weren't, are Novgorod, Suzdal, and Ryazan, since in historical texts of XI-XII centuries they are mentioned as separate entities from Rus’. They can be considered parts of extended Rus’, although their culture was distinct from main Rus’.

In 1493 Moscow prince Ivan III appointed himself to be the Great Ruler of All Rus’. No other kings acknowledged that. From that point on Muscovy started to make false claims on Rus’ ownership.

“Russia” is an offshoot of Ukraine and not the other way round, despite what Soviet and “Russian” historians have been trying to say for years. Kiev was a developed cultured capital when Moscow was just another swamp village.




Germany used to call itself the Holy Roman Empire, that didn’t mean they became the Romans, and all of a sudden had a right to claim whole of Italy and its history, but yet, that’s exactly what “Russia” did in regards to Rus’-Ukraine, which is a horrible injustice!",1

My dream spec for a gaming monitor would be pretty close to this:  42 inches or so, anti-glare, normal aspect ratio not ultra wide, but 1440 @ 200mhz instead of 4k (because not even a 3090ti will do anywhere near 4k @ 138mhz in most decent looking aaa titles anyway).

If possible, i had a couple of suggestions for things to look at over the course of your full review:

- What do resolutions other than 4k look like on the monitor (try playing a game in 1080/1440 and seeing what the monitor's scaling is like)
- In the settings, what HDR options are available?

It is just a tool to help then when interrogating so they can have an idea if when they are being lied too, or who they should focus on. They still need to investigate and find actual  PROOFV to convict you. If you didn't do it, they can't convict you just because you seemed like you were lying.",0

"The kid wasn't ""front line""; when Friend went out walking, he stumbled across the toads doing their normal thing; foraging. The kid was out learning.
Toadette knew that Friend wasn't a danger to fish-kind. The movie drop subtext hints that, like Starship Troopers, the ""monsters"" weren't the random violent one; Gruner started it. Likely by killing some/many of them, and fish-napping a female member of their tribe to use as his own personal fleshlight. 

Peace was plenty possible and Friend figured it out, he just wasn't very smart as shown in the rest of the video. All he had to do was offer them Gruner, at least at that point. 

Even at the beginning of the movie, we're set to think he's going to be attacked when they come knocking on his door; but that's the director using our bias and expectation in monster movies. They were curious, sure, and maybe marking the territory, but they weren't attack-oriented until after Friend got antsy. 

I wonder if the tadpole Gruner killed was his own!?",1

"The part where they're talking about the initial rollout of the SNES in North America hits home. They mention something about how expensive it was for the time, and how the state of the US economy in 1991 meant it was probably the only ""toy"" the average American parent could buy their kids that year. Took up the entire toy budget.

That happened to my family. Christmas 1991 and all my brothers and sisters are there, 4 of us ranging from 10 to 18 years old. My parents had a single present for the 4 of us, the Super Nintendo with Super Mario World.

It was one of the best gifts of all our lives, because we had all wanted the SNES badly. We literally played it all that Christmas Eve night and into Christmas day. It's a great family memory that we all still hold with us, now all in our 40's and 50's with families of our own.",1

"The problem I have with those overly stressful education systems is that I wonder if they actually work and if the students learn effectively through them. What I learned through self-defense practice, and military documentaries is that stress and anxiety seem to decrease your ability to focus, and are not an effective way to learn. In self-defense, instructors increase stress by making you do cardio-based exercises to make your body artificially feel stress (accelerated heartbeat, difficulty to breath, difficulty to focus) only to test your ability to reproduce the technique properly when your focus is the least optimal, but they don't do it for learning purposes. The military seems to do it too in their own way.
I would also point out that every doctor in the world (with common sense) would tell you that there is a considerable difference between the way we think we perform under fatigue and the way we actually perform under fatigue.
It's funny how the little girl in the video who had an allegedly stress-free education in kindergarten was able to catch up with her classmates in a few months.
I wonder how the students who went through this type of education system would perform against students from other countries. Here, in France, we don't have that type of education system, nor in the United Kingdom (I studied for 2 years at a British university).",0

"Very entertaining, one thing amazing about sports are the things that happen that are unexpected.  I remember my wife was given a free ticket to a Diamondbacks game, which went zero/zero so she finally left and when she came home she said ""I got bored with the game"".  The Diamondbacks went on to score seven runs in the last inning after she left, winning the game.  

I teased her endlessly after that, suggesting she should not attend more D-backs games, and they went on to win the world series that year, my wife not in attendance but glued to their last game with the Yankees and Luis Gonzalez base hit that won the game.

I met Joe Montana, and that football season he went on to win his last superbowl, and I saw the ending in French, in Montreal, in '90.   During my flight from SFO to Toronto and the connecting flight to Montreal, our Air Canada pilot gave us updates on a one-sided blowout.

I also will never forget the Stanford/Cal game in 82 and ""The Play"" when Cal beat Stanford, and the band became part of the game.  Some still argue over two of the lateral passes, but the win for Cal was as it was, and I still say, that is among the craziest moments in sports history.

My own crazy moment was when I was called in to play center for our grammar school flag football team, even though I was the smallest player on ours and the opposing team, the school we played had no players above the sixth grade, so I agreed.  We won the game, though I had only played center in school practice and never in a competitive game.  Adrenalin had me psyched, and our QB said I threw perfect spirals.  I would intimidate the bigger players since they feared I'd plow under them and stop them from getting to the QB, and they never did, he was not sacked.

Our team went on to win the Norcal championship, undefeated, in our twelve team league, my brother playing as wide receiver, though I no longer had to play since the school had seventh and eighth graders.  I never went on to play in high school, feeling I was too small to be as good as I was in my grammar school game, where I also played on the defense, and I stuck to distance cycling and golf, both of which I enjoyed and also had many ""crazy"" moments, and I was decent at the 440 as it was then, now the 400 meters.

Even in my early 60's now, and despite a leg I broke badly in a freak accident a couple of years ago, I still enjoy cycling as well as hiking and also laser tag and go kart racing.

On my channel here @Cactus521 I even have a video of me jumping off the Vegas Stratosphere tower when I was 52, though the wind was so fierce my eyes watered, I felt peace, and not fear, on the way down, choosing that vs. skydiving as my free fall bucket list item, since there is no reason to jump out of a perfectly good airplane. 😂",2

"We are so obsessed with time just like someone already said in the comments. But on the other hand we will always find time for the things that truly matter to us and that's what Laura Vanderkam says in her talk.
I used to rush myself on the bike to school and I love cycling.. but I wanted to be there as fast as possible so that I'd have more time to study. Yet every time I would rush through, I'd be stopped at the red lights and the slower cyclers would catch up with me, making me feel frustrated with the time I was wasting waiting at the red lights. All I was left with was more sweat, frustration and muscle pain. So I decided this was not going to do it. Now I cycle every morning to school at a slow pace enjoying the nature: the rain, the sunshine, the wind, the smells of life, everything, listening to the city or the birds. I even have time to stop if I see a cat and try to give it some snacks. I arrive at school feeling relaxed and ready for the day. It's my favorite thing to do now. 
Making a priority list will make your life better. Especially the relationships and self categories. Taking time to just be present in the moment and live. Ignore the smartphone and technology as long as possible and talk to your loved ones instead. 
Or instead of procrastinating by scrolling through Facebook, watch a TED talk. You won't feel like you've wasted your time after that. 
Thanks for the inspiring talk. I'm getting back to work now. Time to review my priority list.",1

Worthless movie and screwed up sound track ..... Don't even try,0
"Would be cool to see more sports getting in the game via updates. Would love to see Waterpolo, Surfing, Kayaking as water based sports, Ice Hockey, Skiïng and snowboarding as winter sports. But also skating, skateboarding, basketball, baseball as more summer based sports. I could see a very special potential for other uses for the leg strap, like keeping in balance in surfing and snowboarding, making a triangle shape to break in skiïng and do some tricks like flips in skateboarding.",2
Would love to see an EDC/daily tech for everyone else in The Studio!,2
Wouldn’t it be epic if Cinema Summary made his own death game 💀,1

"Wow, you really went to town on the PSU test rack. That's a serious bit of kit. Very flexible, good choices. Wouldn't surprise me if Choma start offering this bespoke rack to the PSU makers. They all watch your videos, so they'll want to make sure it passes on this exact same rack. You can really push the industry here. Well done. Open source the test interface hardware and software.",2

Xhaka as a player summarizes Arsenals rebirth. Absolutely love that we kept him,2

YES the airlines should pay for hotels food transportation from and to airports. Full refunds. They make billions on all if us and we get to sleep in the airports floors. 😡 Yes make them all responsible for their mess ups,0
"Yes, for your sponsor Grover. If you keep renting a product until you reach its retail price, you can keep it forever for a symbolic dollar. Or, if you fall in love with an item before that, you can also pay it off at any point. So the only issue I find with that is why must we have to pay retail for a refurbished  or used item?",1
"Yes, my fellow Texans, stay alert, because if anything happens we are on our own.

"You are carrying great tech, and it makes total sense that you are rellying more and more on Apple, their ecosystem is really good. I am an Android user and don't stick to just one brand but my wife is All-Apple and she really likes how seemless everything is. Cool stuff Marques.",2

"You know the main character is smart when there aren't that many comments on what he could've done differently for each challenge after the first one. The concept of this series seems interesting. I hope there's more!

You know you’ve made it in life when you can wear glasses like that with absolute conviction.,2
You left off the most important consideration: How many bottle holders do you have?,1
"You missed a feature on the airbolt. Instead of using the big part of the loop to lock your zippers, lock the zippers on the loop where the 2 notches are. That way you can't open the bag 3 inches.",0
You reach true confidence by letting everything go.,2
You should do an offroad test with all the trucks in the swamp next to the military base:/,0
"You will continue to suffer if you have an emotional reaction to everything that is said to you.  True power is sitting back and observing things with logic.  True power is restraint.  If words control you that means everyone else can control you.  Breathe, and allow things to pass.",1

Your videos make my weekend. It is something perfect that I can watch with my 4-year-old what we have lunch and it distracts him because his mom is leaving to work. Your videos honestly are lifesavers. Thank you,2

"Yup, it's amazing though how the market then changes brands for each country. In germany we have an entirely different line of knock-off chinese brands. Which ultimately look alike same goes for the Australian / american market. I am kinda stoked to see though what sort of dashcams are actually used within South Korea, Japan if anybody could give a hint to that! I mean surely they must have great dashcams right? Japan being the leading technology country in the 80s and having a severe amount of car enthusiasts, and well South Korea being well the main birth place of any technology centre and fab well at least a good portion in my mind.

I bought this one due to a recommendation from a friend of mine. Problem I have with it is quality related the G-Sensor broke not long after I bought the thing and started using it kinda unfortunate. This creates an issue of the thing constantly making emergency recordings. And in that mode you can't disable the screen from flashing so at night drives you'll really get beamed in your faze and think someone put a flashlight up to your head nope. It's your f#+*^# dashcam You can improve further the video quality for e.g. when experincing intense sun glare which is usually caused on these by using a ND-Filter you just have to find your own way to mount them. Usually there is full filter clamping solutions. Because you'll have to overshoot with the filter anyhow.

I didn't do this yet as I did not find it nessecary to do so but a big german dashcam clip compilation maker did recommend this in one of his dashcam review videos half a year ago or so 
name of the channel is ""Eure Videos Fahrnünftig""
